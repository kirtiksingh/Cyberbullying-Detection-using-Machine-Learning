Cyberbullying Detection: Identifying Hate Speech using Machine Learning


### Description

Bullying has been prevalent since the beginning of time, Itâ€™s just the ways of bullying which
have changed over the years, from physical bullying to
cyberbullying. 

This project presents a systematic review of some
published research on cyberbullying detection approaches
and examine methods to detect hate speech in social media,
while distinguishing this from general profanity, and does
a comparative study of various Supervised algorithms,
including standard, as well as ensemble methods. 

### Result
The evaluation of the result shows that Ensemble supervised
methods have the potential to perform better than traditional supervised methods. A number of directions for
future work are also discussed.
