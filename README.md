Cyberbullying Detection: Identifying Hate Speech using Machine Learning

## Description

Bullying has been prevalent since the beginning of time, Itâ€™s just the ways of bullying which
have changed over the years, from physical bullying to
cyberbullying. Due to the massive rise of user-generated web content, particularly on social media networks, the amount of hate speech is steadily increasing. Hate speech online has been linked to a global increase in violence toward minorities, including mass shootings, lynchings, and ethnic cleansing. 

This project presents a systematic review of some
published research on cyberbullying detection approaches
and examine methods to detect hate speech in social media,
while distinguishing this from general profanity, and does
a comparative study of various Supervised algorithms,
including standard, as well as ensemble methods. 

## Dataset 
- Tweets Dataset for Detection of Cyber-Trolls obtained from [DataTurks](https://www.kaggle.com/dataturks/dataset-for-detection-of-cybertrolls?select=Dataset+for+Detection+of+Cyber-Trolls.json)
- Data Cleaning, Preprocessing (Word Tokenization, Stemming, TF-IDF), and Resampling was done before application of any of the Machine Learning algorithms used. 

## Methods Used 
- Gaussian Naive Bayes 
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Adaboost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier 


## Result
The evaluation of the result shows that Ensemble supervised methods have the potential to perform better than traditional supervised methods. A number of directions for
future work are also discussed.
